        <p>I'll be joining Podium this winter as a product management intern. At Podium I will be working with the head PM and CPO to pioneer a new data product for Podium to offer to their customers. The product has yet to be fleshed out, but it
          will probably be something for predicting customer purchase potential. My previous internship experience has been mostly technical and I'm excited to learn new skills from a product role. Eventually I want to be able to build my own
          startups or
          work at early-stage startups, so having product experience will be super valuable.</p>

        <p>This fall I joined Elevation Capital as an investment analyst intern. Elevation Capital is Utah's largest VC fund. They invest in software startups. I wanted to get experience on the investment side of tech for two reasons. First, I wanted
          to learn about a ton of different startups so I have context for when I work on startups. Second, I want to know how the funding process works for startups. I want to be able to know exactly how to secure funding from a VC firm. It's been a
          ton of fun so far and I've gotten to meet tech CEO's, research 2-3 companies per week, and dig into markets and monatization.</p>

        <p>Apple was probably my favorite internship. I joined a computer vision team working to combine muliple camera views for object detection. At the conclusion of my project, I had improved accuracy by an average of 31%. I also got to compete
          in the iContest (pitching features and products to Apple on a team of interns), hackathons, presentations, and poster symposiums. Surprisingly my biggest gain was learning the value of good presenting and how to build a great presentation.

        <p>Joining Microsoft for a summer internship was one of my best decisions. I received phenomenal mentorship and learned how big tech is managed and run. I worked on Microsoft Azure, their cloud platform. While I was there I built 3 APIs to
          let
          customers know which versions they can upgrade or downgrade their clusters to. These APIs serviced 1,600+ customers and resolved daily customer service calls. I worked remotely, which was a bit of a bummer. In the end I received an offer to
          return fulltime, but I decided to
          turn it down to pursue opportunities outside of software engineering.</p>
