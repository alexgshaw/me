        <p>Ever since my senior year of high school, I have been passionate about physical fitness. I feel like physical fitness is neglected by most people, despite being one of the most direct influences on our mental and physical wellbeing. If you
          start working out regularly, you begin feeling better surprisingly fast. One of the most interesting lessons I have learned at BYU was that your brain only produces new neurons during sleep or during exercise. So
          maybe some people should put down their homework for a second and go workout. It could end up saving you time!</p>

        <p>I think that nutrition is neglected almost as much as personal fitness. The average person doesn't connect the dots between how they feel and what they eat. Eating healthy has helped me to have more energy and feel better. My biggest words
          of advice in this space are ones that I stole from Stanford's Coursera course on health and wellness. Eat real food, mostly vegetables, not too much. Following these three rules has changed the way I prepare and buy meals.</p>

        <p>I grew up attending the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When I was 18 years old I left to serve a 2-year mission in Austria, Swizerland, and Germany. I don't think anything has changed my life as much as the two years I spent
          in Europe as a missionary teaching people about Jesus Christ. Faith in God is close to my heart and has shaped the principles that I live by. I carry these principles with me into all aspects of my life, personal and professional.</p>

        <p>I love sports. Mostly playing sports, but I also enjoy watching sports. My favorite way to pass free time is to play pickup sports. Soccer and hockey are my favorites, but being in Utah I have started to pick up pickleball, golf, and
          spikeball as well. Also being able to participate in intramurals and student wellness classes has been a really enjoyable part of my college experience.</p>
